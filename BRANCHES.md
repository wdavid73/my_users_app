# üöÄ Branch Guide for the Project

This document outlines the use of branches within the project and the steps to follow for incorporating changes from feature branches into a base branch (`develop`).

## üìå Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Development Branch (if it doesn't exist)
```sh
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate Changes from a Feature Branch to `develop`
To bring changes from a specific branch (`feature-branch`) into `develop`, use:
```sh
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge feature-branch
git push origin develop
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Delete the Branch After Merging (optional)

```sh
git branch -d feature-branch  # Local
git push origin --delete feature-branch  # Remote
```
